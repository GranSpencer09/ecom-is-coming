# ecom-is-coming

## Description
This application is crucial for assisting companies running an eccommerce website and mainitaining a product database. The app helps the company by providing the routes to pull any profuct info neccessary. While working on this project, I relearned the proper way of organizing routes as well as how to build them with less code.


## Installation

- Navigate to the code [repository](https://github.com/GranSpencer09/ecom-is-coming)
- Press the green code button, located near the about section
- Copy either the HTTPS, Git CLI, download the zip, open with GitHub desktop, or copy the SSH link
- Depending on download method, use Git, executable, or the desktop application to open the content files
- All of the content of the repository will be available after completion of the previous state


## Usage
[Video walkthrough](https://app.castify.com/view/32f03990-6990-45f4-84fe-5a4ca671b974) of the app. After viewing the walkthrough, and installing the code on your local system, run the commands as I do in the walkthrough. You'll need to download packages, create the database and seed it. Then start the server, navigate to Insomnia and begin adding the requests with the proper URLs and neccessary JSON data.
